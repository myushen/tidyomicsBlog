Switching from bulk RNA-seq to single-cell, or from expression data to genomic ranges, often felt climbing a different mountain. Tidyomics keeps the **underlying objects exactly the same** while giving them a single, tidyverse-flavoured grammar so that moving from bulk RNA-seq to single-cell or spatial data is no harder than shifting between two dplyr pipelines.  Its design principles take inspiration from the tidyverse philosophy of clear, human-readable code as articulated by Wickham *et al.* (2019) ([JOSS 10.21105/joss.01686](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01686)).\n\nThat question snowballed into an international collaboration—and ultimately into `tidyomics`.\n\n# What is Tidyomics?\n\n![Tidyomics Logo - The official logo of the tidyomics ecosystem](logo.png){width=\"120px\"}\n\n`tidyomics` is an open project to develop and integrate software and documentation to enable a tidy data analysis framework for omics data objects ([Hutchison *et al.* 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02299-2)). The development of packages and tutorials is organized around [tidyomics open challenges](https://github.com/tidyomics/). Tidyomics enables the use of familiar tidyverse verbs (`select`, `filter`, `mutate`, etc.) to manipulate rich data objects in the Bioconductor ecosystem. Importantly, the data objects are not modified, but tidyomics provides a tidy *interface* to work on the native objects, leveraging existing Bioconductor classes and algorithms.\n\n`tidyomics` is a set of R packages by an international group of developers. The ecosystem allows for code such as:\n\n```r\nsingle_cell_data |>\n  filter(Phase == \"G1\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(UMAP_1, UMAP_2, color=score)) + \n  geom_point()\n```\n\n(filter single cells in G1 phase and plot UMAP coordinates)\n\nor\n\n```r\nchip_seq_peaks |>\n  filter(FDR < 0.01) |>\n  join_overlap_inner(promoters) |>\n  group_by(promoter_type) |>\n  summarize(ave_score = mean(score))\n```\n\n(compute average score by the type of promoter overlap for significant peaks)\n\n## Core Principles\n\nThe tidyomics ecosystem is built on several fundamental principles:\n\n- **Tidy interface to native objects**: Provides tidy verbs while preserving Bioconductor object structure\n- **Verbose, jargon-free vocabulary**: Function and variable names are designed to be self-explanatory\n- **Minimal temporary variables**: Reduce the need for intermediate variables through chaining operations\n- **Consistent interfaces**: Provide uniform interfaces across different data containers\n- **Compatibility**: Work seamlessly with existing Bioconductor and tidyverse workflows\n\n## Omics Integration Under a Unique Consistent Interface\n\nThe tidyomics ecosystem provides a unified approach to omics data analysis, enabling seamless integration across different omics domains through a consistent tidy interface.\n\n![Tidyomics Network Integration - A diagram showing how the tidyomics ecosystem integrates different omics domains through a consistent tidy interface](tidyomics_net.png){.center-image width=80%}\n\nThis integration allows researchers to work with transcriptomics, genomics, and other omics data using the same familiar tidyverse verbs, regardless of the underlying data structure.\n\n# Core Packages\n\nBefore diving into the individual packages you can simply load the **meta-package** and immediately gain access to all tidyomics functionality:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"tidyomics\")   # CRAN or r-universe when available\nlibrary(tidyomics)  # loads tidySummarizedExperiment, tidySingleCellExperiment, plyranges, etc.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWith a single call you have a tidy interface ready for bulk, single-cell and genomic range data.\n\n## Transcriptomics Packages\n\nEach tidyomics package tackles a real-world analytical challenge.  Bulk RNA-seq analyses, for example, are traditionally scattered across disjoint data frames, objects and helper lists.  `tidySummarizedExperiment` re-imagines a `SummarizedExperiment` as a tibble-first citizen: you can `filter()`, `mutate()` and `group_by()` genes or samples exactly as you do with any tidyverse data frame.  For single-cell data the same philosophy inspired `tidySingleCellExperiment`, while for users of the Seurat workflow we created `tidyseurat`, a drop-in tidy wrapper that never compromises the original Seurat object.\n\n### tidySummarizedExperiment\nThe tidy interface for `SummarizedExperiment` objects, enabling tidyverse operations on bulk RNA-seq data.\n\n**GitHub**: <https://github.com/tidyomics/tidySummarizedExperiment>\n\n### tidySingleCellExperiment\nSingle-cell experiments often contain millions of cells and dozens of matrices.  `tidySingleCellExperiment` flattens this complexity so you can focus on the biology instead of the bookkeeping.\n\n**GitHub**: <https://github.com/tidyomics/tidySingleCellExperiment>\n\n### tidyseurat\nFor Seurat users, `tidyseurat` adds the missing tidyverse layer without forcing you to abandon familiar Seurat functions.\n\n**GitHub**: <https://github.com/stemangiola/tidyseurat>\n\n### tidySpatialExperiment\nSpatial transcriptomics combines gene expression with tissue geography. `tidySpatialExperiment` brings the tidy philosophy to `SpatialExperiment` objects so you can transform, visualise and model spatial spots with the same verbs you already use for bulk and single-cell data.\n\n**GitHub**: <https://github.com/william-hutchison/tidySpatialExperiment>\n\n## Genomics Packages\n\nGenomic ranges represent locations along chromosomes—think of them as the geographical coordinates of the genome.  With traditional Bioconductor tools, even simple tasks such as “take promoters and find overlaps with ATAC-seq peaks” require specialised syntax.  The tidy answer is **`plyranges`**, a grammar that lets you manipulate `GRanges` with the fluency of dplyr verbs.  And because biology is three-dimensional, the sister package **`plyinteractions`** brings the same elegance to chromatin-interaction data.\n\n### plyranges\nA tidy interface for genomic ranges data, providing a grammar of genomic data manipulation.\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/tidyomics/plyranges](https://github.com/tidyomics/plyranges)\n\n## Analysis Packages (tidyomics ecosystem)\n\nThe core adapters above focus on **data representation**; the packages below provide high-level analysis grammars that build on those tidy foundations.\n\n### tidybulk\n\n**GitHub**: <https://github.com/stemangiola/tidybulk>\n\n### plyinteractions\nA tidy interface for genomic interaction data, enabling analysis of chromatin interactions.\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/tidyomics/plyinteractions](https://github.com/tidyomics/plyinteractions)\n\n\n# Publications\n\n*Hutchison W.J.*, *Keyes T.J.*, *et al.* (2024). **“The tidyomics ecosystem: enhancing omic data analyses.”** *Nature Methods* 21, 1166–1170.
